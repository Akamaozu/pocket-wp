### Description

Pocket WP connects to the Pocket API and pulls in your latest saved links with tags and excerpts into a WordPress page, post or widget.

#### Setup

Due to the way Pocket's API works, you need to complete a few steps before you can use the plugin.

1.  Install and activate the plugin.

2.  Create an application on the [Pocket Developers website](http://getpocket.com/developer/apps/new), enter your Consumer Key into the Pocket WP settings page and click Save Changes to start the authorization process.

3.  Click the Get Access Key link to complete the authorization.

#### Shortcode

The shortcode embeds a list of Pocket links into a page or post.

The basic shortcode is `[pocket_links]` and it accepts some optional arguments:

    count: [any number] // How many links to display. Default is all.`</pre>

    <pre>`excerpt: yes, no // Whether or not to display the excerpt extracted by Pocket. Default is yes.`</pre>

    <pre>`tag: [any one of your Pocket tags] // Choose to show links from one tag. Supports one tag only. Default is all links, tagged or untagged.`</pre>

    <pre>`credit: yes, no // Choose to add author credit. Default is to not show credit links.`</pre>

    tag_list: yes, no // Whether or not to show a list of tags after each link.`

    #### Widget

    The Widget is available to drag and drop into any widgetized sidebars. It has some options:

    <pre>`title // the title for the widget`</pre>

    <pre>`count // the number of links to show. Default is 5`</pre>

    <pre>`tag: [any of your Pocket tags] // Choose to show links from one tag. Currently supports one tag only. Default is all links, tagged or untagged.
